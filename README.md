# Zig Snippets

Welcome to **zig-snippets**, a repository of useful Zig code snippets.

Zig is a "_general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal, and reusable software._"
You can learn more about Zig at [ziglang.org](https://ziglang.org).

This repository will serve as a catalog of categorized Zig code, and I encourage any contributions of useful Zig code snippets. Together, we are all more successful.
